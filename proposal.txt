                    DEVOPS CI/CD PROJECT PROPOSAL
================================================================================

PROJECT TITLE
-------------
Production-Grade CI/CD Pipeline with DevSecOps for House Arena Backend API

GITHUB REPOSITORY URL
---------------------
https://github.com/sailingsam/gilfoyle-cicd

APPLICATION DESCRIPTION
-----------------------
House Arena Backend is a lightweight Node.js/Express REST API that provides:
- Health check endpoints for Kubernetes probes
- System status and metrics endpoints
- Stateless architecture ideal for containerization and scaling

Tech Stack: Node.js 20, Express.js, Docker, Kubernetes (AWS EKS)

CI/CD PROBLEM STATEMENT
-----------------------
Manual software deployment processes face critical challenges:

1. Human Error: Manual deployments are error-prone and inconsistent
2. Security Gaps: Vulnerabilities often reach production undetected
3. Slow Releases: Manual testing and deployment slow down delivery
4. No Quality Gates: Code quality issues slip through without automation
5. Environment Drift: Inconsistencies between dev and production environments

This project solves these by implementing automated CI/CD with integrated
security scanning (DevSecOps) to ensure only tested, secure code reaches
production.

CHOSEN CI/CD STAGES AND JUSTIFICATION
-------------------------------------
CI PIPELINE:

| Stage              | Tool           | Justification                          |
|--------------------|----------------|----------------------------------------|
| Checkout           | actions/checkout| Retrieve source code for pipeline     |
| Linting            | ESLint         | Enforce code standards, prevent debt   |
| SAST               | CodeQL         | Detect code vulnerabilities (OWASP)    |
| SCA                | npm audit      | Find vulnerable dependencies           |
| Unit Tests         | Node test      | Validate logic, prevent regressions    |
| Docker Build       | Buildx         | Containerize for consistency           |
| Container Scan     | Trivy          | Find OS/library CVEs in image          |
| Container Test     | curl/docker    | Verify image runs correctly            |
| Registry Push      | DockerHub      | Publish trusted image for deployment   |

CD PIPELINE:

| Stage              | Tool           | Justification                          |
|--------------------|----------------|----------------------------------------|
| AWS Configure      | aws-actions    | Authenticate with cloud provider       |
| Update kubeconfig  | aws eks        | Connect to Kubernetes cluster          |
| Deploy to EKS      | kubectl        | Apply K8s manifests                    |
| Health Check       | kubectl/curl   | Verify deployment success              |
| DAST               | curl           | Basic runtime security testing         |
| Rollback           | kubectl        | Auto-recover on failure                |

EXPECTED OUTCOMES
-----------------
1. Fully automated build, test, and deployment pipeline
2. Security vulnerabilities detected before reaching production
3. Consistent deployments via containerization
4. Zero-downtime deployments with rolling updates
5. Auto-scaling based on CPU/memory utilization
6. Automatic rollback on deployment failures
7. Complete audit trail via GitHub Actions logs
8. Reduced deployment time from hours to minutes
